        <h2>The Myth of the Minotaur</h2>
        <p>The Minotaur is one of the most iconic creatures in Greek mythology. It had the body of a man and the head of a bull, and was born from a curse placed on Queen Pasiphaë by the god Poseidon. The creature was the offspring of Pasiphaë and a magnificent bull sent by Poseidon to King Minos of Crete, as part of a divine test.</p>
        <p>Due to its monstrous nature, King Minos had the Minotaur imprisoned within the labyrinth, a massive and complex maze designed by the genius inventor Daedalus. The labyrinth was built under the palace of Knossos, and it became a place of dread for many as it was used to imprison sacrificial victims from the defeated city of Athens.</p>

        <h3>The Origins of the Myth</h3>
        <p>The story of the Minotaur comes from ancient Greek mythology and is most famously documented in texts by ancient authors such as Ovid in his <em>Métamorphoses</em> and Plutarch in <em>Theseus</em>. It is believed that the myth was passed down orally for generations before being written in these forms. The tale is deeply tied to the Bronze Age civilization of Crete, specifically the Minoan civilization, where the palace of Knossos and the labyrinth were said to have existed.</p>
        <p>Greek mythology often intertwines the natural, the divine, and the monstrous, and the Minotaur myth is a representation of the consequences of human pride, divine retribution, and the struggle between civilization and savagery.</p>

        <h3>The Labyrinth</h3>
        <p>The labyrinth was no ordinary maze. Daedalus, the master craftsman, designed it to be a near-impossible puzzle. Once someone entered, they could easily lose their way within its winding, disorienting paths. It was here that King Minos trapped the Minotaur, feeding it sacrificial victims sent from Athens as part of a tribute imposed after a military defeat.</p>
        <p>The only person known to have successfully navigated the labyrinth was the hero Theseus. With the help of Princess Ariadne, who provided him with a ball of thread to trace his path, Theseus was able to find his way back out of the labyrinth after slaying the Minotaur.</p>

        <h3>Key Characters in the Myth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theseus:</strong> A prince of Athens who volunteered to be sent into the labyrinth. With Ariadne's help, he defeated the Minotaur and escaped the labyrinth.</li>
            <li><strong>Ariadne:</strong> The daughter of King Minos, who fell in love with Theseus and gave him a ball of thread to help him escape the labyrinth after killing the Minotaur.</li>
            <li><strong>Daedalus:</strong> A brilliant inventor and craftsman who created the labyrinth. He later helped Ariadne and Theseus by explaining how to escape the maze.</li>
            <li><strong>King Minos:</strong> The ruler of Crete, who imprisoned the Minotaur in the labyrinth and demanded sacrifices from Athens as punishment for their rebellion.</li>
            <li><strong>Minotaur:</strong> The monstrous offspring of Pasiphaë and a divine bull, confined to the labyrinth and fed on human sacrifices.</li>
        </ul>
