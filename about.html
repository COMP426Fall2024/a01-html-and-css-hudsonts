        <h2>The Myth of the Minotaur</h2>
        <p>The Minotaur is a creature from Greek mythology with the body of a man and the head of a bull. It was born from the union of Queen Pasiphaë of Crete and a majestic bull, a result of a curse laid upon Pasiphaë by the god Poseidon. The Minotaur, due to its monstrous nature, was confined to a labyrinth built by Daedalus, a master craftsman, at the order of King Minos of Crete.</p>

        <h3>What is the Labyrinth?</h3>
        <p>The labyrinth was an elaborate maze designed to be inescapable, a prison for the Minotaur and a place where sacrificial victims, including youths from Athens, were sent to meet their doom. Daedalus crafted it in such a way that once someone entered, they could not find their way out without knowing the secret. Theseus, with the help of Princess Ariadne, was the only one to successfully navigate the labyrinth and defeat the Minotaur.</p>

        <h3>Entering and Navigating the Labyrinth</h3>
        <p>Navigating the labyrinth was a nearly impossible task, as its winding corridors and confusing dead-ends were designed to disorient and trap anyone who entered. Only with a special thread given by Ariadne, which Theseus used to mark his path, was the hero able to find his way out after defeating the Minotaur.</p>
